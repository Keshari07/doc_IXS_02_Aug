About Us:

OneBanc is a neo-bank, building the economic infrastructure for the workforce of India. The idea of OneBanc started when a young girl asked Vibhore, a serial entrepreneur, why the money in her piggybank never grew. Adopting this philosophy of #DemandMore, OneBanc connects enterprises, banks, and HR Tech platforms to enhance value for all stakeholders. The core team has proven their vision and executive prowess in CoCubes – a complete assessment solution for students and institutes, which was acquired by Aon. They are now building the squad to enable FinTech revolution of the future.
